        <h1>JOBERT AGDAHAN</h1>
        <p>Representative Block C</p>
        <h6>Hello! I’m Jobert Agdahan, a 26-year-old from the beautiful province of Bukidnon. I’m currently a first-year student in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program and proud to represent Block C. I’m a friendly and approachable person who loves meeting new people and building connections. Outside of school, I’m happily taken and enjoy spending time with my loved ones. One of my hobbies is reporting – I find it exciting to gather and share information. I’m looking forward to learning and growing with all of you during this amazing journey!
